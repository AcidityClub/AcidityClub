# Hi!
Hello, I'm Gavin. I love playing video games and making modifications for them.

## Game Modifications
### Minecraft
In the past, I've made several Minecraft server plugins and clients (ModCoderPack-based). This includes things like:

- My replica of XenonServices/TehNeon's Nitrogen core-plugin, which is based (code-wise) on Minemen Club's ClubCore.

- A fork I made of AntiGamingChair (used on Minemen Club). This added a TON of improvements over the original source I was using as the base.

I also own my own Minecraft network server, although it isn't available to join just yet.

### Roblox
Back then, I worked on Roblox executor scripts and Roblos games. The scripts I am known for are:

- Reflex V3, a mod menu for games like Arsenal.

## Experience
### Java | 1-2 Years
Although I haven't really spent a lot of time on Java, I have a decent understanding on how it works and such. I mainly use Gradle for my projects, but I've tried Maven as well.

### Lua (Roblox) | 2-3 Years
Before I started working on Minecraft projects (Java), I used to make Roblox games and (not really good but) Robloz executor scripts.

### CSharp | ~1 Year
I've worked with this a little bit, but I've forgotten a lot of the language features and syntax.
